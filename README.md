# Fitness Tracker 

## MongoDB Atlas Application

This application is a fitness tracker that allows the user to track cardio and resistance training workouts.  The user enters the paramaters for the workout, i.e., duration, weight, total time, etc. and can it to the application's database.  Once they have added the workout, they can complete the workout and their created/completed workouts are shown on the user's dashboard.  The dashboard also shows the last seven days' workouts, and their stats for their previous workouts.
